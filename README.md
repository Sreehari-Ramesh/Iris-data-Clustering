# TSF-Task2
In this execise we will be using the python code to predict the optimum number of clustering groups from the given iris data set as input using the unsupervised machine learning kMeans algorithm . 
Unsupervised learning mean we dont know about the relation between datas. 
We have to find the relation betwen data and find an optimum number of cluster.
